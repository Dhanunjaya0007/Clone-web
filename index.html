            <h2>About JavaScript</h2>
            <p>JavaScript is a versatile, lightweight programming language primarily used to add dynamic and interactive elements to web pages, but also used for 
                server-side applications and even game development. It works with HTML and CSS to create engaging user experiences.
                <br>
                Here's a more detailed look at JavaScript:
                <br>
                Key Features and Uses:
                <br>
                Dynamic Content:
                <br>
                JavaScript allows web pages to change and update without requiring a full page reload, making them more interactive and engaging. 
                <br>
                Client-Side and Server-Side:
                <br>
                While commonly used on the client-side (in web browsers), JavaScript can also be used on the server-side with frameworks like Node.js.
                <br>
                Versatile Applications:
                  Beyond web development, JavaScript is used in:
                  Web Applications: Creating complex web applications with dynamic features. 
                  Server-Side Development: Building APIs and backends with Node.js. 
                  Game Development: Developing games using frameworks like Phaser or Three.js. 
                  Desktop Applications: Creating desktop applications using frameworks like Electron.

            <h2>HTML</h2>
            <p>HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is a code used to create web pages. It's the basic building block of the web, and it tells web browsers 
                how to display web pages. 
                <br><br>
                What HTML does
                Defines the structure and meaning of web content 
                Annotates text, images, and other content for display in a web browser 
                Adds meta information to web pages, such as the name of the person who created the page 
                Enables users to structure sections, paragraphs, headlines, links, blockquotes, and more 
                How HTML is used 
                HTML is often used with Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and JavaScript
                CSS is used to change the way HTML looks
                JavaScript tells websites how to behave
                HTML features 
                HTML is a text-based language, which means that it is made up of text and tags
                HTML is platform independent
                HTML is case insensitive
                HTML supports media, such as images, sound, and video
                HTML history 
                HTML was created in 1990 by Sir Tim Berners-Lee, a British computer scientist who is credited with inventing the World Wide Web</p>

            <h2>CSS</h2> 
            <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for specifying the presentation and styling of a document written in a markup language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML).[2] CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.[3]

                CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation, including layout, colors, and fonts.[4] This separation can improve content accessibility, since the content can be written without concern for its presentation; provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.
                
                Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in different styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser or screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules for alternative formatting if the content is accessed on a mobile device.[5]
                
                The name cascading comes from the specified priority scheme to determine which declaration applies if more than one declaration of a property match a particular element. This cascading priority scheme is predictable.
                
                The CSS specifications are maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Internet media type (MIME type) text/css is registered for use with CSS by RFC 2318 (March 1998). The W3C operates a free CSS validation service for CSS documents.[6]
                
                In addition to HTML, other markup languages support the use of CSS including XHTML, plain XML, SVG, and XUL. CSS is also used in the GTK widget toolkit.</p>

                <h2>Blog</h2>
                <p>A blog (short for "weblog") is a regularly updated website or webpage where individuals or groups share their thoughts, experiences, or expertise on a specific topic through written content, often in an informal or conversational style. 
                    <br>
